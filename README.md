# Restaurant Search

# Goal

There are several search engines on the web that are able to search a large dataset based on the queries that are entered by the user. In this project, I wanted to create a search engine for restaurants in America that can help the user find a restaurant of their choice based on a set of priorities the user has, such as location, food type, etc.

# Methodology

I created a software that is able to search a large dataset of restaurants and return a set of resulting restaurants based on specific search criteria such as number of stars, type of food served, etc. Moreover, I also engineered this system so that search queries can be chained together in arbitrary orders, much like a user on a website like Yelp, for example. “Find a vegan restaurant in Wyoming that is at least 2 stars” is an example of a multiple-chained-query that can be done on a large dataset using this software system.
